# Neosoft code style for android
The code styles below are strict rules for contributing Java code to the Android project. 

***Please install and configure attached coding style:***

    Open android Studio environment.
    Import settings.jar into Android Studio. It defines our coding style.  

You just need to use ***File -> Import Settings*** option in Android Studio. (Do not add file into project, its for the android studio).

To format the code according to our style, either ***right click on java file/package -> reformat code or ctrl+alt+L.*** (Check optimize imports and rearrange entires).

Please make sure you format the code before committing, this will help us in reducing lot of unnecessary conflicts and improve readability.
